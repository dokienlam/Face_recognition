README - Face Recognition with Haar Cascade and Tkinter

Welcome to the Face Recognition application utilizing Haar Cascade and Tkinter! This project aims to provide a simple yet effective solution for recognizing faces using the Haar Cascade classifier and deploying it within a Tkinter GUI framework.

Features:

Face Detection: The application utilizes the Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in images.
Recognition: Once faces are detected, the system can recognize and label them accordingly.
User-friendly Interface: The graphical user interface (GUI) is developed using Tkinter, making it intuitive and easy to navigate.
Dependencies:

Python 3.x
OpenCV library
Tkinter library
Installation:

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
Install the required libraries using pip.
--pip install opencv-python--

Clone this repository to your local machine.
--git clone <repository_url>--

Navigate to the project directory.
--cd face_recognition_haar_cascade_tkinter--

Usage
Run the application by executing the main.py file.
--python main.py--

Once the application launches, you'll be presented with the GUI.
Use the provided options to load an image and perform face recognition.
The application will display the image with recognized faces labeled.
